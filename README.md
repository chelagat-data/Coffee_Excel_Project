### Top 5 Customers

- Helps identify growth or decline patterns in sales over time.

## Insights and Observations

- **Sales Peaks:** Coffee sales peak around February-March and August-September, likely due to increased coffee consumption during colder months and post-vacation routines.
- **Sales Dips:** Sales tend to dip in May and November, possibly due to outdoor activities in warmer weather and holiday spending priorities.
- **Cultural Impact in the UK:** The growth of the coffee market in the UK is somewhat limited by the traditional preference for tea, despite a strong coffee culture and presence of coffee shops.
- **US Market Growth:** The proliferation of coffee shop chains like Starbucks and Dunkinâ€™, along with local cafes, has significantly contributed to the growth of the coffee market in the US by serving as social hubs and convenient purchase locations.

## Action Plan

- **Expand Marketing Efforts in the UK:** Increase brand visibility and customer engagement through targeted advertising, promotions, and partnerships with local cafes and retailers to boost sales.

- **Introduce Specialty Coffee Offerings in Ireland:** Capitalize on the growing coffee culture by offering unique blends, single-origin coffees, and innovative brewing methods to attract discerning coffee enthusiasts and expand market share.

- **Enhance Customer Loyalty Programs in the US:** Strengthen customer retention by offering exclusive discounts, rewards, and personalized perks to loyal customers, encouraging repeat purchases and boosting sales.
