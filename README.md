### Top 5 Customers

- Helps identify growth or decline patterns in sales over time.

## Insights and Observations

- **Sales Peaks:** Coffee sales peak around February-March and August-September, likely due to increased coffee consumption during colder months and post-vacation routines.
- **Sales Dips:** Sales tend to dip in May and November, possibly due to outdoor activities in warmer weather and holiday spending priorities.
- **Cultural Impact in the UK:** The growth of the coffee market in the UK is somewhat limited by the traditional preference for tea, despite a strong coffee culture and presence of coffee shops.
- **US Market Growth:** The proliferation of coffee shop chains like Starbucks and Dunkin’, along with local cafes, has significantly contributed to the growth of the coffee market in the US by serving as social hubs and convenient purchase locations.

## Action Plan

- **Expand Marketing Efforts in the UK:** Increase brand visibility and customer engagement through targeted advertising, promotions, and partnerships with local cafes and retailers to boost sales.

- **Introduce Specialty Coffee Offerings in Ireland:** Capitalize on the growing coffee culture by offering unique blends, single-origin coffees, and innovative brewing methods to attract discerning coffee enthusiasts and expand market share.

- **Enhance Customer Loyalty Programs in the US:** Strengthen customer retention by offering exclusive discounts, rewards, and personalized perks to loyal customers, encouraging repeat purchases and boosting sales.
